      'The abandoned asylum had always been a source of curiosity for the people living in the small town. For years, it had been left untouched, with its broken windows and peeling paint. It was said that the asylum had been closed down after a fire had killed several patients and staff members. But there were rumors that something more sinister had happened inside its walls.\nAs the years went by, the town forgot about the asylum, until a group of teenagers stumbled upon it one night. They had been out exploring the woods when they saw the dark silhouette of the building looming in the distance. Intrigued, they decided to investigate.\n They crept through the broken gate and made their way towards the main building. As they walked through the dark corridors, they could hear strange whispers and footsteps behind them. They turned around, but there was no one there.\n "Guys, this place is really creeping me out," said one of the teenagers. "Maybe we should turn back."\n "Nah, come on, we\'ve come this far," said another. "Let\'s see what\'s inside."\n Suddenly, one of the teenagers felt a cold hand on their shoulder. They screamed and ran towards the exit, but the door wouldn\'t budge. They were trapped.\n\n The whispers grew louder, and the footsteps became more frantic. The teenagers huddled together, trying to stay calm. But they could feel a presence closing in on them.\n As they turned a corner, they saw a figure standing in front of them. It was a woman, dressed in a tattered hospital gown.\n Her hair was long and stringy, and her eyes were hollow. She reached out to them, and they could see that her hands were covered in blood.\n The teenagers screamed and ran in the opposite direction. They could hear the woman\'s laughter echoing through the corridors. They ran faster, their hearts pounding in their chests.\n Finally, they reached the main entrance. But as they pushed the doors open, they found themselves face to face with the woman. She smiled at them, revealing her sharp teeth.\n The teenagers were never seen again. The townspeople searched the asylum, but they found no trace of them. Some say that they were taken by the woman in the hospital gown, and that they still haunt the abandoned asylum to this day.\n Years later, a group of ghost hunters decided to investigate the abandoned asylum. They had heard the stories of the teenagers who had disappeared, and they wanted to see if there was any truth to them.\n They arrived at the asylum just before sunset. The building looked even more eerie than they had imagined. The windows were shattered, and the paint was peeling off the walls.\n "Are you guys ready?" asked the leader of the group. "Let\'s go inside."\n As they walked through the corridors, they could feel the weight of the building bearing down on them. They heard strange noises coming from the shadows, and they felt like they were being watched.\n Suddenly, one of the members of the group felt a hand on their shoulder. They turned around, but there was no one there.\n "Did you guys feel that?" they asked.\n The other members of the group shook their heads. "Maybe it\'s just your imagination," said one of them.\n They continued on, but the feeling of being watched only grew stronger. They saw strange symbols etched into the walls, and they could hear strange whispers coming from the darkness.\n As they turned a corner, they saw a figure standing in front of them. It was the woman in the hospital gown. "Who are you?" asked the leader of the group.\n The woman didn\'t answer. She just smiled at them, revealing her sharp teeth.\n The ghost hunters tried to run, but the doors had locked behind them. They were trapped.\n The woman started to laugh, her voice echoing through the halls. The ghost hunters could feel her energy draining theirs. It was as if she was absorbing their life force.\n They tried to fight back, but their equipment was useless against her. The woman was too powerful.\n Suddenly, the lights flickered, and the woman disappeared. The ghost hunters took the opportunity to run towards the exit. They were able to pry the door open, and they stumbled out into the sunlight.\n As they caught their breath, they looked back at the asylum. The building looked even more menacing than before. It was as if the woman had awakened something dark inside it.\n The ghost hunters never went back to the abandoned asylum. They knew that the woman in the hospital gown was too dangerous. They warned others not to go near it, but some people still do.\n Over the years, more and more people have disappeared after entering the asylum. The townspeople have tried to have it torn down, but every time they try, something stops them.\n It\'s as if the asylum is protecting the woman in the hospital gown. And she continues to lure people inside, draining their life force and adding to her power.\nThe abandoned asylum is now a place of fear and mystery. The townspeople avoid it at all costs, but some say that they can still hear the woman\'s laughter echoing through the halls at night.\n And those who dare to venture inside are never seen again.\n',

      "Amidst the verdant trees and rustling leaves, The symphony of nature hums and weaves, A melody of beauty, so sweet and pure, That fills the soul, and makes it secure.\n The soft rustle of leaves, like a gentle breeze, A sweet lullaby that puts the heart at ease, The chirping of birds, a joyous sound, That echoes through the woods, all around.\n The rustling of grass, the buzzing of bees, The fragrance of flowers, carried on the breeze, The trickling of streams, the patter of rain, All blending together, in a wondrous refrain.\n The rustling of leaves, the whistling of wind, The rustle of branches, that creak and bend, The symphony of nature, so grand and bold, A symphony that never grows old.\n For nature's melody is a timeless thing, That fills the heart with joy, and makes it sing, So let us pause, and listen with care, To the symphony of nature, so rare.\n",
